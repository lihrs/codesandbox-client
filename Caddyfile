# To use HTTPS, change the next line after comments into your specific domain.

# The domain name should use the same second-level domain as Tango.
# For example, if Tango is hosted on tango.example.com, then you can set it to
# any subdomain of example.com like csb.example.com.

# For local development, make sure you've put your domain into your hosts file,
# and point it to 127.0.0.1.
# For production, make sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly
# pointed to this machine's public IP.
